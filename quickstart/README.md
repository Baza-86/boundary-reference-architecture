# Quickstart Terraform
This folder contains a basic Terraform script for HCP/OSS Boundary that sets up an Org, a Project, and a Target. 

Prerequisites: The Boundary cluster must be deployed.

Disclaimer: the examples in this repository are for demonstration purposes only to convey how to get Boundary up and running
on popular cloud and container platforms. They're not officially supported modules or designed to be "production" ready. They're
here as a starting point and assume end-users have experience with each example platform.
